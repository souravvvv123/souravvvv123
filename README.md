Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I am Sourav Chakraborty

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in Offensive Security.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Application Security Projects.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Application Security.

âš¡ Fun fact: I take help of ChatGPT and Stackoverflow and use it as a refence instead of copying the code and pasting it.
